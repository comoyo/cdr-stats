+	  Talk+ client receiving a call (incoming) from PSTN SIP-trunk. Time is measured from our SIP infrastructure receives the SIP-INVITE message until the Talk+ client responds with the SIP-RINGING notification. Talk+ client is on a 3G network connection in this case.

+	  <h3>Talk+ outgoing call to PSTN</h3>
+	  Talk+ client initiating a call that ends up on the PSTN network through the SIP-trunk. The receiver could either be on a GSM-mobile-phone or a fixed-line-telephone. Time is measured from the Talk+ mobile (3G/Wi-Fi) presses the call button until our SIP server infrastructure receives the SIP-RINGING notification.
+	  Footee setup time is the time needed to verify and authenticate the user and calling rights, basically the time we can optimize on our side.
+	  Talk+ client to server side is the time from the call is started until the server side initiates the call forwarding.

+	  <h3>Talk+ outgoing call to Talk+ (IP-to-IP)</h3>
+	  Talk+ client initiating a call to another Talk+ client. Both caller and receiver can be on either 3G or Wi-Fi networks. Calls are only residing in the Talk+ server infrastructure and never touches the regular phone network (PSTN).
