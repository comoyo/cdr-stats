When developing for cdr-stats, use a virtualbox and not your system so that you just can create a new machine if installation fails.

To install on a clean machine fetch the install script from github.

    wget –no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/comoyo/cdr-stats/master/install/install-cdr-stats.sh -O install-cdr-stats.sh

run it:
	
    sudo bash install-cdr-stats.sh
	
During the installation you will be asked to chose between Freeswitch/Asterisk, chose Freeswitch
Then chose to install all.

Sometimes the installation will fail, so you need to check that the install was a success. This
can be done by using telnet to the default installation port 8008.

    sudo telnet localhost 8008
    GET

And check that what you get looks like the correct website.
If the installation fails, create a new machine and install again.

Then you need to change /usr/share/cdr_stats/setting_local.py so that it points to our mongodb.
That is done by changing the MONGO_CDRSTATS URI at the end of the file.
	
If you install to staging/prod you need to setup port forwarding so that we can access the server on port 80.

    iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
    iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 8008 -j ACCEPT
    iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8008

Then fix so that the iptable is restored by default on reboot, for example like this:

    https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo#Solution_.232_.2BAC8-etc.2BAC8-network.2BAC8-if-pre-up.d_and_...2BAC8-if-post-down.d

If you need to update an already installed version of cdr-stats. Copy the modified files into the correct location at /usr/share/cdr_stats
Do not try to run the installscript again, that will ruin the installation.

There is no uninstall script. If things go wrong start over with a clean machine.
