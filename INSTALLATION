When developing for cdr-stats, use a virtualbox and not your system so that you
just can create a new machine if installation fails.

To install on a clean machine fetch the install script from github. You can run
this script from anywhere, and it will install the latest version from the
repository, not the local copy where you might be reading this document :-)

    ~> wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/comoyo/cdr-stats/master/install/install-cdr-stats.sh -O install-cdr-stats.sh
    ~> sudo bash install-cdr-stats.sh

During the installation you will be asked to chose between Freeswitch/Asterisk,
chose
    1) Freeswitch
Accept the license.
    YES
Then chose to install everything, with
    1) Install All.

The installation will download a lot of required components, so this takes a
while. After a while you will need to configure access to a user
   User name: (Blank for root)
   Email: <your-email-address>
   Password: ******
   Repeat password: ******

The installation will then try to install all the necessary components.

Sometimes the installation will fail, so you need to check that the install was
a success. This can be done by using telnet to the default installation port
8008.

    ~> sudo telnet localhost 8008
    GET
    ^D (Ctrl+D)

And check that what you get looks like the correct website. If the installation
fails, create a new machine and install again, as there is no uninstall method.

Then you need to change /usr/share/cdr_stats/setting_local.py so that it points
to our mongodb, and add the username and password for MongoDb to the same file.

That is done by changing the MONGO_CDRSTATS URI, USER and PASSWORD at the end
of the file. For example for staging:

MONGO_CDRSTATS = {
    'DB_NAME': 'cdr-stats',
    'HOST': 'localhost',
    'PORT': 27017,
    'CDR_COMMON': 'cdr_common',
    'DAILY_ANALYTIC': 'daily_analytic',
    'MONTHLY_ANALYTIC': 'monthly_analytic',
    'CONC_CALL': 'concurrent_call',
    'CONC_CALL_AGG': 'concurrent_call_aggregate',
    'URI': 'mongodb://url:29017,url:url:29017',
    'USER': 'XXXX',
    'PASSWORD': 'XXXX'
}

For production, the port numbers of the mongodb servers should be 27017, not
29017 as for staging.

If you install to staging/prod you need to setup port forwarding so that we can
access the server on port 80.

    ~# /sbin/iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
    ~# /sbin/iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 8008 -j ACCEPT
    ~# /sbin/iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8008

Then fix so that the iptable is restored by default on reboot, for example
like this:

    https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo#Solution_.232_.2BAC8-etc.2BAC8-network.2BAC8-if-pre-up.d_and_...2BAC8-if-post-down.d

If you need to update an already installed version of cdr-stats. Copy the
modified files into the correct location at /usr/share/cdr_stats Do not try to
run the installscript again, that will ruin the installation.

There is no uninstall script. If things go wrong start over with a clean
machine.

After setup is complete, restart the cdr-stats service and apache:
   ~> sudo service cdr-stats-celeryd restart
   ~> sudo service apache2 restart

Open your web browser to the local serice at port 8008 to test, e.g.:
   ~> firefox http://localhost:8008 &

Login with the username and password that was used in the installation process
above: (root/******)
